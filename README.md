# Strategic_Consultancy
This repository is my personal path into consulting. I’m building it as a place where I capture the things I’m learning and the skills I’m developing to become a better consultant. I’ll learn industry by industry, case by case, and expand the structure as my needs grow.
I’m starting with the epistemology of consulting — understanding how consultants think, how they learn, and how they approach problems. When you don’t know where to begin, starting with the word’s epistemology and then its history gives enough context and direction, so that’s where this journey starts as well.As I explore more, I’ll branch the folders naturally based on what I need. This includes the tools, frameworks, templates, and concepts required to think like a consultant.

# What This Repo Will Contain
 - Core concepts and foundations of consulting
 - Industry folders that expand as I explore them
 - Case studies
 - Frameworks, mental models, and strategy tools
 - Notes on epistemology, history, and context
 - Tools, templates, and anything that helps me think clearly

# Purpose
This repository is not just storage — it’s a learning path.
A slow, structured way for me to understand consulting deeply and build the habits, clarity, and problem-solving approach that good consultants use.
# How It Will Grow
I will:
 - Start from first principles
 - Expand industries one by one
 - Add tools as I discover them
 - Build a large library of case studies
 - Let the structure evolve organically as the work increases
 - This is a long-term project, and I’ll keep refining it as I learn.
